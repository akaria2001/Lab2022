1) Refactor destroyLab.py to use pure Python and not shell out, use lxc list -f (lxc list -f csv) to specify format that is easier parse then work on it
2) Refact spinUpSampleLab.sh to spinUpSampleLab.py and use pure Python, clean up logic to be more dynamic, there is currently a lot off cut and paste code :(
3) Re-write os_update.sh in  Python
4) Look at defining the lab in json and write a script to create the lab from json
