1) Refactor destroyLab.py to use pure Python and not shell out, use lxc list -f (lxc list -f csv) to specify format that is easier parse then work on it - completed
2) Refact spinUpSampleLab.py and use pure Python, clean up logic to be more dynamic, there is currently a lot off cut and paste code :( - completed
3) Re-write os_update.sh in  Python
4) Look at defining the lab in json and write a script to create the lab from json - will use toml instead, see point 12 below
5) Within main() function for destroyLab.py, move the instance deletion logic to destroyLab() function - completed
6) Example to show remote images :- lxc image list -c lat images: -f csv 'alpine'
7) Start standardising names for variables, arrays and functions, current a mix between bouncyCaps and hyphenated naming, need to make this consistant
8) Refactor LabMenu.py to not call external python scripts via subprocess, use import instead - completed
9) Fix linting errors, increase Flake8 line length allowance
10) Fix spelling mistake
11) Add logging
12) First pass at writing stack script to generate lab from toml. Will add following in near future

Check to see instance exists - if it does then shut it down and re-configure it based on values in toml file, don't attempt to create it.
If instance doesn't exist, then create it and configure it based on values in toml file
